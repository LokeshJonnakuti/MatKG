# MatKG
Code Base for MatKG Dataset paper

MatKG is a comprehensive Knowledge Graph of Materials Science that captures a diverse range
of entities and relationships from scientific literature. MatKG includes materials, properties, applications, characterization methods,
synthesis methods, symmetry phase labels, and descriptors, among other entities, which are extracted automatically using
advanced natural language processing methods from over 5 million papers in the domain. Relationships between these entities are established using statistical means, resulting in a knowledge graph with over 150,000 entities and 3.5 million unique triples. MatKG is the largest knowledge graph in the field of materials science at the time of writing, and its development represents a significant advance in the organization and accessibility of materials science data
